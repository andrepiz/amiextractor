# amiextractor
A set of functions and utilities to extract and process images acquired by the AMIE camera of the SMART-1 mission.

The _decode_IMG_ function allows to extract labels, browse image and image from a binary IMG file retrieved from the AMIE database https://archives.esac.esa.int/psa/ftp/SMALL-MISSIONS-FOR-ADVANCED-RESEARCH-AND-TECHNOLOGY/AMIE

The _extract_IMG_ function calls _decode_IMG_ and also retrieves ancillary data that may be useful to fit for instance the expected moon size and location against the image:

Finally, there is also the possibility to correct the images for bias and dark current, by extracting the master frames from the CALIB IMG directory [1]:
